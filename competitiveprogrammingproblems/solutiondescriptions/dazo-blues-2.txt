The intended solution of the problem is to adapt the solution of the previous problem into a function to be used to test whether or not the given parameters has a solution. With this new test function we made we can easily use a binary search to find the smallest value that satisfies the condition. However, a second solution was found. The second solution involves using only dp and greedily taking the minimum of maximums. Intended solution has a time complexity of O(N^2 * logN) while the contestant-found solution has a time complexity of O(N^2). I recommend reviewing both programs.
