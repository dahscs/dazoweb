The problem attempts to misguide the reader in a few different ways. Firstly, there is only 1 way to create any number with the given method. This is because the method is based off of the binary number system. Thankfully computers conviently run on a binary number system, so there are many ways to count the bits in a number. The problem also said the bounds were up to 10^12. This means 64-bit integers should be used.
