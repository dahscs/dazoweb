The problem can be solved relatively easily with dynamic programming. Each state will be determined by the current index in the song, and the current lung compression dazo has. The song length is at most 25000 and the lung compression has 200 different states, we can represent them all as positive while computing. This makes for a total time complexity of 25000*200 = 5000000, which will run in under a second.
